The specific systems presented in Project Plan I aim to facilitate coordination and information sharing, as well as easy to use systems.  Each project is briefly described below and its objectives are identified.  As applicable, each system is intended to provide high-level data and finance transaction security for its customers' transactions.  The systems I have chosen for these projects are an online furniture storefront, a Real estate One-Shop Store, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.  The approach is to develop systems that are highly functional and deliver value to its intended customers.

The online furniture storefront must offer user registration in order to buy furniture or to browse even without registration.  The system must display the furniture, enable a shopping cart or wish list, a payment module, a shipping module and a functional inventory control.
The assumption is that the main vendor has a valid account with the wholesale furniture distributor and is able to link to their website to
display to customer the available furniture.  The payment module should calculate sales tax and shipping charges accordingly.

The Real estate system should offer buyers, sellers and renters a one-stop display of homes for sale or rent out of a specified
inventory.  A seller should be able to get insight of what he or she must do before putting their home for sale in the real estate 
market.  A buyer must be able to browse homes he/she may be interested in buying. The system should be able to provide user registration,
agreements/forms to fill out and sign, and a payment module for specified fees.  

The (BMI) calculator should provide an easy to use program to calculate body fat index for males and/or females.  This system should display a gender module, height, weight, age and specific body measurements module in order to calculate the individual BMI.  

Not all the above systems require to secure agreements with outside vendors, a test phase, training and implementation.  The systems should also run 24/7, and should enhance effective data and technical monitoring as well at to provide high levels of data security.  Another addition to monitor customer satisfaction is to randomly request customer feedback as applicable.
