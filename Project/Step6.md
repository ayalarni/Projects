#TSQL#Project6

Project 6 of TSQL required to implement the database I designed on Project X and to create a video describing the process.  The instructor provided an option to provide a write up of the process instead.  The write up of the process of my Database follows. 

I created a new database named Database, consisting of four Tables defined as Customer, Store, Account, and Item. The Customer table attributes were defined as CustID, CustName, CustCity, State, and PhoneNo.  The Store Tables attributes 
were defined as StoreCode, StoreName, and StoreAddress.  The Account Table attributes were defined as Ord_Num, Order_Date Date, Ord_Amount, and Ord_Desc.  The Item Table attributes were defined as ItemID, ItemColor, Itemsize, ItemPrice, and ItemType.

Then records or values were inserted into each of the Table agents to fully implement the tables accordingly.

A moderately sufficient amount of data exists into the Tables to allow for testing, and develop a moderate sufficient number of queries to test the database to ensure it works properly.

The SQL file containing the implementation code is my deliverable of this Database Project.
